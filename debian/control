Description: Polaric Server: APRS daemon part. 
 The "Polaric Server" which is mainly a web based service to present APRS 
 tracking information on maps and where the information is updated at real-
 time. It is originally targeted for use by radio amateurs in voluntary search
 and rescue service in Norway. It consists of a web application and a server 
 program (APRS daemon). 
 .
 The APRS daemon gathers data from a TNC or APRS-IS or both. It can present 
 and manipulate the information through a simple HTTP service. The daemon can 
 also be set up as an igate (internet gateway) and can be installed 
 independently of the web app.
