   - Filter support. Polygons/extent filter, scale, projection, selected base layer, etc..

  restart server.
* Status indication on channels. RUNNING, NOT-RUNNING, FAILED?
* Allow backup channels which are automatically started when primary

  Some parts of APRS specific classes moved to generic class.     
* Framework for Views (MVC pattern) for Point objects. Easily extendable for subclasses.
